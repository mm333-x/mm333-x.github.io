At heart, I'm most passionate about **offensive security engineering** and **cyber threat intelligence**, where creativity meets strategy in the pursuit of understanding and outsmarting adversaries.

Driven by curiosity and shaped by real-world challenges, I work at the intersection of **offensive security**, **defensive security**, **software engineering**, and **artificial intelligence** — building systems that think, adapt, and defend.

I'm especially intrigued by the complex attack surfaces in **telecommunications**, **ICS**, and **SATCOM**, and I'm actively expanding my knowledge to better understand how to secure these critical infrastructures.

In an era where cyber systems underpin national resilience, I explore cybersecurity through a **strategic systems lens** — where **technology**, **policy**, and **preparedness** converge to shape not just defense mechanisms, but the future of national security itself.
